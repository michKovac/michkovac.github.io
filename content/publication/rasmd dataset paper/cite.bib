abstract = {Current autonomous driving algorithms heavily rely on the visible spectrum, which is prone to performance degradation in adverse conditions like fog, rain, snow, glare, and high contrast. Although other spectral bands like near-infrared (NIR) and long-wave infrared (LWIR) can enhance vision perception in such situations, they have limitations and lack large-scale datasets and benchmarks. Short-wave infrared (SWIR) imaging offers several advantages over NIR and LWIR. However, no publicly available large-scale datasets currently incorporate SWIR data for autonomous driving. To address this gap, we introduce the RGB and SWIR Multispectral Driving (RASMD) dataset, which comprises 100,000 synchronized and spatially aligned RGB-SWIR image pairs collected across diverse locations, lighting, and weather conditions. In addition, we provide a subset for the RGB-SWIR fusion, Super-resolution, translation task, and object detection annotations in challenging traffic scenarios to demonstrate the utility of SWIR imaging through experiments. Through the various downstream tasks, we verified the validity of our dataset. Especially, combining RGB and SWIR data significantly improves detection accuracy compared to RGB-only approaches. We anticipate that the RASMD dataset will advance research in multispectral imaging for autonomous driving and robust perception systems. The RASMD dataset is publicly available in https://the-website-will-be-included-after-review.}

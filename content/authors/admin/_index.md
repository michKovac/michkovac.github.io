I am a Ph.D. student at the [Slovak University of Technology in Bratislava](https://www.stuba.sk/english.html?page_id=132), where I work on deep learning for ophthalmology with a focus on automated eye disease diagnostics and synthetic data generation to improve the robustness of AI-assisted medical imaging systems. My research lies at the intersection of computer vision, medical imaging, and artificial intelligence.

In collaboration with the [Seamless Trans-X Lab (STL)](https://stl.yonsei.ac.kr/) at [Yonsei University](https://www.yonsei.ac.kr/), I have contributed to the development of a multispectral dataset for autonomous driving and co-authored the paper "[RASMD: RGB and SWIR Multispectral Driving Dataset for Robust Perception in Adverse Conditions](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1566253525009340)" published in [Information Fusion](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/information-fusion). I also served as a co-organizer of the [MIRA Workshop](https://multispectral4ra.github.io/) at [ICCV 2025 in Hawaii](https://iccv.thecvf.com/), focusing on multispectral imaging for robotics and automation.

My research interests include deep learning for perception systems, multispectral and infrared imaging, and AI applications in healthcare.

Outside of research, I enjoy hiking, climbing, exploring nature, and traveling.
